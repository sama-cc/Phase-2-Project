# Genshin Team Creator

Genshin Team Creator (GTC) is a Single Page Application built in React that helps players create, edit, and save different team compositions for the game "Genshin Impact".

## Description

GTC is an application designed to be a tool to assist in creating and saving team compositions for Genshin Impact.  Genshin Impact has a large cast of characters from which teams of four can be assembled.  The game rewards players for creating different team compsitions to take on different challenges and enemies. GTC streamlines the team-building process by helping players keep track of the different teams they have assembled and displays the character details for each team member in an easy-to-read manner.  Additionally, GTC makes it easy to edit one's pre-existing teams with the click of a button. If a player wants to change the team name, a character or multiple characters in a team it's as simple as selecting a replacement from a drop-down menu.

GTC is also great for theory-crafting your next team. On the "Character" page a player can search or filter characters by name, vision type, weapon or rarity.  This makes it as-easy-as-ever to find the best characters for your team!

With its intuitive layout and simple-but-feature-rich design GTC is the premier Team Creator app for Genshin Impact and more features will be coming in the future!

1. Name Search - This input field on the search bar allows for searching through the character list by character name. Partial matches are allowed.

The search button must be activated or the "Enter" key must be pushed to initiate the name search.

2. Search Button - Activating this button will initiate the name search using whatever was entered in the Name Search input field.

    - Rarity selector - This allows for filtering the character list by Rarity (4 Star or 5 Star).

4. Filter Button - Activating the filter button initiates the filter parameters of the character list.

5. Reset Button - Resets the search and filter parameters to default showing all characters in the character list.

## FAQ

- Q. I keep getting an alert saying "The character is already on the team!"

    A. Currently, in Genshin Impact, you cannot have the same character twice on your team while playing in singleplayer mode. This application was designed for singleplayer as one does not have control over what characters another player will have in co-op mode.

- Q. When I Search or filter characters on the character page nothing shows up.

    A. This is because no character meets your search or filter criteria.

- Q. I noticed information that is innacurate. Can you please fix it?

    A. Please contact me using the email listed in the Support section.

- Q. I am experiencing a bug. Can I get help?
